This is a monorepo containing multiple frontend projects and libraries. Each sub-directory should be treated as an independent project.
When analyzing a sub-directory, prioritize its local `README.md` for specific instructions.
If you make changes that affect dependencies, build steps, or environment configuration, you must update the corresponding `README.md` file to reflect these changes.
