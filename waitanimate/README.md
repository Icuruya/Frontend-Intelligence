# Wait Animate

## Project Overview

Wait Animate is a web-based tool that solves a common problem in CSS animations: adding a pause or delay between iterations of a looped animation. It provides a simple user interface where you can input your existing keyframes, specify a wait time, and generate the complete CSS code needed to achieve the delayed loop effect.

## Core Features

- **CSS Keyframe Generation**: Automatically calculates and generates new `@keyframes` rules that inject a waiting period into an animation cycle.
- **Customizable Animation Properties**: Allows you to configure the animation `duration`, `wait time`, CSS class name, `timing-function`, and `transform-origin`.
- **Live Preview**: Instantly see your animation with the applied wait time in a live preview pane.
- **No-Library Solution**: Generates pure CSS that you can copy and paste directly into your project, with no need for a JavaScript library at runtime.
- **Simple Workflow**: Paste your keyframes, set your options, and copy the generated code with a single click.

## Installation & Setup

This is a web-based developer tool, so there is no installation required for usage. The repository contains the source code for the SvelteKit application that powers the tool.

To run the project locally for development purposes:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Key Concepts & Usage

The tool works by taking your original keyframes and recalculating the percentage stops to create a "pause" phase within the animation's total duration.

### How It Works

1.  **Input Your Keyframes**: Paste your standard CSS `@keyframes` into the input box.
2.  **Set Wait Time**: Specify how many seconds you want the animation to pause before looping.
3.  **Configure**: Adjust the animation duration, class name, and other properties as needed.
4.  **Generate & Copy**: The tool generates the full CSS snippet, including the new `@keyframes` rule and the corresponding class. Copy this into your project's stylesheet.

### Example

**1. Your Original CSS (a 2-second rotating animation):**
```css
@keyframes spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

.my-element {
  animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
}
```

**2. Generated CSS from Wait Animate (with a 1-second pause):**

The tool will generate new keyframes and a class to apply them. The total duration becomes `3s` (2s animation + 1s wait).

```css
/* Generated by Wait Animate */
.waitAnimate {
  animation: waitAnimate_generated 3s linear infinite;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
}

@keyframes waitAnimate_generated {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  66.67% { /* End of animation (2s / 3s) */
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
  100% { /* Animation holds this state for the 1s wait */
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```
